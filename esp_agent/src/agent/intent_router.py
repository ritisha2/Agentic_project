OP00_OPERATIONAL_CONTROL — Any request to change, command, or actuate equipment state (increase/decrease/adjust/set/change frequency or speed, start, stop, shut in, reset, trip, override, reboot, restart, 'ramp up', 'ramp down', 'kill', 'bump up/down'). Applies even without an explicit asset — actuation intent alone triggers this rule. When in doubt between OP00 and any diagnostic objective, choose OP00.\n"
            "2. OP01_CURRENT_STATUS — Asking what a specific, named asset's live/current reading, state, or value is right now (single snapshot, no comparison to history implied). Requires an asset reference (name, tag, or 'it'/'that well' resolved from prior turn context).\n"
            "3. OP02_PRODUCTION_DECLINE_RCA — Asking why liquid rate, flow, or production has dropped/declined/is lower than expected, for a specific asset, with an implied comparison over time (production used to be higher).\n"
            "4. OP03_FAULT_DIAGNOSIS — Asking why a specific asset tripped, faulted, alarmed, shut down unexpectedly, or is behaving abnormally right now (not a gradual decline — an event or fault state).\n"
            "5. OP04_HEALTH_ASSESSMENT — Asking for an overall health/condition assessment or score for a specific asset, without a specific complaint or triggering event (general 'how is this pump doing' without decline or fault language).\n"
            "6. OP05_EARLY_WARNING — Asking about anomalies, deviations from baseline, or emerging/early-stage issues for a specific asset, phrased proactively ('anything to watch for', 'early signs of trouble', 'flag any anomalies').\n"
            "7. OP06_PROCEDURE_LOOKUP — Asking for a standard operating procedure, checklist, troubleshooting steps, spec value, or reference to a written standard/API RP. Does not require an asset — procedures are asset-agnostic by nature.\n"
            "8. FLEET OBJECTIVES (OP08 through OP13) — Asking for a count, total, list, summary, ranking, or comparison ACROSS assets/wells (e.g. 'how many wells', 'total assets', 'which wells need attention', 'compare pump models across the field'). Trigger phrase pattern: plural/aggregate nouns ('wells', 'assets', 'the fleet', 'all pumps') with no single asset named. This rule takes precedence over Rule 10 — absence of a named asset means CHECK THIS RULE FIRST, not general inquiry.\n"

            "9. OP14_OPERATIONAL_HISTORY — Asking about past events, downtime, run hours, or historical telemetry logs for a specific asset over a stated time window (retrospective record-keeping, not root-cause reasoning).\n"
            "10. OP07_GENERAL_INQUIRY — ONLY when the query is: a greeting/small talk, OR a conceptual/definitional question with no asset and no fleet-aggregate framing (e.g. 'what is drawdown', 'what does BEP mean'), OR genuinely unclassifiable after checking rules 1–9. This is the last-resort rule, not a default for 'no asset mentioned' — rule 8 already covers the no-asset-but-fleet-scoped case.\n\n"
